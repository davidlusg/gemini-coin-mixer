# gemini-coin-mixer

This is a humble attempt at a mixer implementation for a fictitious Jobcoin cryptocurrency.

Clients wishing to mix their jobcoins send a set of addresses to the mixer and are given an address to which they send their coins.

The mixer will then deposit the value of those coins minus a fee to the set of addresses which were provided by the client.


Instructions to run:

1. brew install telnet
2. git clone git@github.com:davidlusg/gemini-coin-mixer.git
3.
